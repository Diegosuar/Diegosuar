I'm a 4th-year Computer Engineering student at Universidad de La Sabana with a focus on Data Analytics. I have experience with Big Data tools such as Prefect, ETL pipelines, Grafana, and Dash, and I use Python libraries like NumPy and Pandas for data processing. I also work with Power BI for data visualization.


As a full stack developer, I integrate backend and frontend technologies with a strong understanding of database management (MySQL, SQL Server, Firebase, OCI) and cloud infrastructure using Google Cloud and AWS. Additionally, I use n8n to automate processes and optimize workflow efficiency.
